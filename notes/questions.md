Hi Blazers (?),

I'm working on a framework specifically designed for UX Designs and Information Architects who wireframe in the browser using HTML/CSS.  A lot of the concepts that I plan to use come from Meteor but will be designed for simplicity. I'd love to use Blaze to handle building templates and managing the DOM but as I'm digging in I'm not sure if it will work.

A couple of questions:

1. Is it feasible to keep track of the template hierarchy? Ideally, I could show what templates are included where to visualize what components are used on a wireframe.
2. Where in the code base should I take a look at how the DOM is managed?
